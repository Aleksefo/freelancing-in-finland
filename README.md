## Background

### Problem

When I started freelancing in Finland as a software developer, I had to spend more than **~200 hours** to figure out how everything works.

I had questions like:

* What are the things you need to do _before_ you establish your company?
* When you setup your company, what are your recurring _obligations_?
* What kind of benefits can you offer yourself as a freelancer and how?
* and many more...

There are guides from Tax administration, Finnish Enterprise Agencies and other places to answer those questions.
However, it was painfully time consuming to extract the information I needed from those guides as the **target audience** of such
guides are the general population and the amount of details and information in them is overwhelming.

### Solution

A guide tailored specifically **to the person reading this README.md on Github**

You are the target audience of this guide if:

* You live in Finland
* You are already working as a software developer
* You want to work as an independent freelance software developer
* You want to establish a limited liability company to offer your services through it

This guide will have 3 sections.

* **Preparation**: What you need to do __before__ you establish your company
* **Foundation**: What you need to do __after__ you establish your company
* **Operation**: What you need to do to __run__ your company

I hope it saves you time üíê

## Preparation

### Startup grant (starttiraha)

**Source of truth**: [TE-services startup grant page](https://www.te-palvelut.fi/te/en/employers/for_entrepreneurs/services_new_entrepreneurs/startup_grant/index.html)

**What is it?** Startup grant is a program to support you to become an entreprenuer.
You will receive the monthly payment for 6 months (if you apply once) or 12 months (if you apply for extension as well).

**How much?** ~680‚Ç¨ per month, as personal income. If your income tax is 25%, for example, you will get 510‚Ç¨.

**Steps** for first application:

* You will be disqualified from startup grant if you have already established your company or started full-time entreprenuership.

* You need a business plan and certain financial calculations as an attachment to your application.
You can use [My Enterprise Finland](https://oma.yrityssuomi.fi/#) and complete the steps for `Business plan` to
draw up your business plan which includes all necessary financial calculations as well.

* Once you have your business plan ready, as an **optional** step, you can send an email with your business plan attached to the
[Enterprise Agency in your city](https://www.uusyrityskeskus.fi/yritysneuvonta/uusyrityskeskukset/) and ask them for an appointment with a _Business Advisor_.
In Helsinki, [_NewCo Helsinki_](https://newcohelsinki.fi/en/) is the Enterprise Agency to go to. Although it is not mandatory to go to this appointment for getting startup grant,
the _Business Advisor_ has seen hundreds of business plans and can guide you to correct your mistakes in the business plan and therefore increase your chances for a successful application.

* You need an updated Resum√© as an attachment to your application.

* You need a [tax debt certificate](https://www.vero.fi/en/About-us/contact-us/efil/information-on-mytax/how-to-request-a-tax-debt-certificate-in-mytax/) as an attachment to your application.

* In your business plan, you have specified how much **own funding** you have available to you.
You need to provide a proof of your claimed own funding as an attachment to your application.
This proof doesn't have to be official. I perosnally printed a pdf from my netbank account overview and that was enough for a successful application.
Also, the amount of money available to you, no matter how high, does not influence the decision of TE-services negatively.

* Apply for startup grant [electronically](https://asiointi.mol.fi/omaasiointi/?kieli=fi) (only available in Finnish)
and you will get a decision within 2 weeks (official estimation).

### Quit your job

**What is it?** The positive decision to your startup grant is on the condition that you will quit your job and become a full-time entreprenuer.


**Steps**:
* **Terminology**: `employee` and `self-employed` are two different terms and they cannot be used interchangably.
* As an `employee`, deliver your binding resignation in written form to your employer.
* After that, and from the first day of your startup grant decision, you are `self-employed`.
