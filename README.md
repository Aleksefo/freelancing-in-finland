## Background

### Problem

When I started freelancing in Finland as a software developer, I had to spend more than **~200 hours** to figure out how everything works.

I had questions like:

* What are the things you need to do _before_ you establish your company?
* When you setup your company, what are your recurring _obligations_?
* What kind of benefits can you offer yourself as a freelancer and how?
* and many more...

There are guides from Tax administration, Finnish Enterprise Agencies and other places to answer those questions.
However, it was painfully time consuming to extract the information I needed from those guides as the **target audience** of such
guides are the general population and the amount of details and information in them is overwhelming.

### Solution

A guide tailored specifically **to the person reading this README.md on Github**

You are the target audience of this guide if:

* You live in Finland
* You are already working as a software developer
* You want to work as an independent freelance software developer
* You want to establish a limited liability company to offer your services through it

This guide will have 3 sections.

* **Preparation**: What you need to do __before__ you establish your company
* **Foundation**: What you need to do __after__ you establish your company
* **Operation**: What you need to do to __run__ your company

I hope it saves you time üíê
