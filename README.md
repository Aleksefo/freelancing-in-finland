## Background

### Problem

When I started freelancing in Finland as a software developer, I had to spend more than **~200 hours** to figure out how everything works.

I had questions like:

* What are the things you need to do _before_ you establish your company?
* When you setup your company, what are your recurring _obligations_?
* What kind of benefits can you offer yourself as a freelancer and how?
* and many more...

There are guides from Tax administration, Finnish Enterprise Agencies and other places to answer those questions.
However, it was painfully time consuming to extract the information I needed from those guides as the **target audience** of such
guides are the general population and the amount of details and information in them is overwhelming.

### Solution

A guide tailored specifically **to the person reading this README.md on Github**

You are the target audience of this guide if:

* You live in Finland
* You are already working as a software developer
* You want to work as an independent freelance software developer
* You want to establish a limited liability company to offer your services through it

This guide will have 3 sections.

* **Preparation**: What you need to do __before__ you establish your company
* **Foundation**: What you need to do __after__ you establish your company
* **Operation**: What you need to do to __run__ your company

I hope it saves you time 💐

## Preparation

### Immigration permit

**Source of truth**: [Finnish Immigration Service](https://migri.fi/en/)

**Steps**:
* If you're a Finnish citizen, this is not applicable to you.
* If you're a EU citizen, I don't know. Do you know? Please send a pull request 💯
* If you're a non-EU citizen, I don't know. Do you know? Please send a pull request 💯

### Freelance brokers

**What is it?** To find a project that you like, there are companies that can help you with that.
Most require a meeting before they let you in their network. It's always a relaxed meeting, though, as you will be _partners_ who will help each other.

**How does it work?** They find you a project. They add around 5-20% to your hourly rate. You invoice them. They invoice the end client.

**What happens in the meeting?**

* They ask if you know their company and depending on that, they introduce you accordingly.
* They ask about your story.
* They ask if there's an industry that you particularly like/dislike to work in.
* They ask about your hourly rate.

**What about hourly rate?** In Helsinki, if we put aside particular situations in which the client has become dependent on a single point of failure developer,
or other extraordinary situations, in an average project with an average client with an average developer, I've heard companies charging their clients between
90-130€ per hour depending on the strength of their brand, the experience of the developers in the team, and the particular relationship with that client.
In extraordinary situations, I've heard of 150-200€ per hour.

However, the ranges above are for direct company-to-client sales. If you get connected to a client using an intermediary broker company, the ranges will be cut
by 5-20%, which would be their cut of the hourly rate. This means that, with one intermediary company, you're looking at 65-105€ per hour in non-extraordinary situations.

**List of brokers**:
* Fika ☕️ with [Talented](https://talented.fi/for-talents/) and get into their Slack and Hub.
* Fika ☕️ with [Tentimes](https://www.tentimesagency.com/) and get into their Slack.
* Fika ☕️ with [Finitec](https://finitec.fi/) and get into their network.
* Fika ☕️ with [Siili One](https://campaign.siili.com/one) and get into their network.

**List of aggragate sites**:
* Create a [job search alert](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/) on Linkedin with:
  * Your `location`
  * Your most important `skill` (Python, for example)
  * Job type as `Contract`
* Create a profile on [Nordgigs](https://nordgigs.com/) which aggragates freelance projects across Nordic countries and email you on a match with your `skill` tags.

### Startup grant (starttiraha)

**Source of truth**: [TE-services startup grant page](https://www.te-palvelut.fi/te/en/employers/for_entrepreneurs/services_new_entrepreneurs/startup_grant/index.html)

**What is it?** Startup grant is a program to support you to become an entreprenuer.
You will receive the monthly payment for 6 months (if you apply once) or 12 months (if you apply for extension as well).

**How much?** ~680€ per month, as personal income. If your income tax is 25%, for example, you will get 510€.

**Steps** for first application:

* You will be disqualified from startup grant if you have already established your company or started full-time entreprenuership.

* You need a business plan and certain financial calculations as an attachment to your application.
You can use [My Enterprise Finland](https://oma.yrityssuomi.fi/#) and complete the steps for `Business plan` to
draw up your business plan which includes all necessary financial calculations as well.

* Once you have your business plan ready, as an **optional** step, you can send an email with your business plan attached to the
[Enterprise Agency in your city](https://www.uusyrityskeskus.fi/yritysneuvonta/uusyrityskeskukset/) and ask them for an appointment with a _Business Advisor_.
In Helsinki, [_NewCo Helsinki_](https://newcohelsinki.fi/en/) is the Enterprise Agency to go to. Although it is not mandatory to go to this appointment for getting startup grant,
the _Business Advisor_ has seen hundreds of business plans and can guide you to correct your mistakes in the business plan and therefore increase your chances for a successful application.

* You need an updated Resumé as an attachment to your application.

* You need a [tax debt certificate](https://www.vero.fi/en/About-us/contact-us/efil/information-on-mytax/how-to-request-a-tax-debt-certificate-in-mytax/) as an attachment to your application.

* In your business plan, you have specified how much **own funding** you have available to you.
You need to provide a proof of your claimed own funding as an attachment to your application.
This proof doesn't have to be official. I perosnally printed a pdf from my netbank account overview and that was enough for a successful application.
Also, the amount of money available to you, no matter how high, does not influence the decision of TE-services negatively.

* Apply for startup grant [electronically](https://asiointi.mol.fi/omaasiointi/?kieli=fi) (only available in Finnish)
and you will get an electronic decision within 2 weeks (official estimation). Official decision letter should arrive by post soon after the decision is served (~1 week).

**Steps** for  application extension:

* I don't know. Do you know? Please send a pull request 💯

### Quit your job

**What is it?** The positive decision to your startup grant is on the condition that you will quit your job and become a full-time entreprenuer.


**Steps**:
* **Terminology**: `employee` and `self-employed` are two different terms and they cannot be used interchangably.
* As an `employee`, deliver your binding resignation in written form to your employer.
* After that, and from the first day of your startup grant decision, you are `self-employed`.

### Genral housing allowance (asumistuki)

**Source of truth**: [Kela general housing allowance page](https://www.kela.fi/web/en/general-housing-allowance)

**What is it?** General housing allowance supports you with housing costs.
Based on [Suomi.fi](https://www.suomi.fi/company/starting-a-business/entrepreneurs-everyday-life-and-livelyhood/guide/securing-entrepreneurs-livelihood/housing-allowance-and-basic-social-assistance-for-entrepreneurs):

> As an entrepreneur, you are entitled to the general housing allowance under the same conditions as anyone else.

**How much?** Based on the assumption that your only source of **personal** income is startup grant,
general housing allowance is ~410€ per month, tax free, for a studio in Helsinki. You can use **source of truth** calculator for exact figures.

**What counts as a `self-employed` person's income from Kela's perspective**?

* Your company:
  * is a `legal entity` with a business ID (Y-tunnus)
  * can **act** like a natural person from the perspective of law
  * pays taxes on its **profits** in the form of _corporate taxation_, 20%, once a year
* You:
  * are a `natural person` with a perosnal ID (Henkilötunnus)
  * are a a natural person from the perspective of law
  * pay taxes on your **income** in the form of _perosnal taxation_, at progressive rates, whenever you receive income
* For the purpose of answering _what counts as a `self-employed` person's income from Kela's perspective_, your company's income is irrelavent.
* Your income is relevant. If you have [YEL insurance](#self-employed-persons-pensions-act-yel):
  * Your YEL insurance `level` is counted as your income, nothing else.
  * You do not need to apply for general housing allowance review unless you change your YEL insurance `level`.
* If you don't have YEL insurance:
  * All your income (salary, benefits, dividends, etc) counts as your income.
  * You need to apply for general housing allowance review if your income increases by 400€ per month.

**Steps**:

* Apply for general housing allowance [electronically](https://asiointi.kela.fi/go_app) (only available in Finnish).
* Mention in application that you have received a positive decision to your startup grant application and you have quit your job.
* Attach your startup grant official decision letter which has come via post to the application.
* Attach your employment certificate which mentions the final date of your employment to the application.
* If you don't have the attachments ready, you can still attach them to the application for ~10 days after sending the application.
* You will receive a decision in ~3 weeks (official estimation).
